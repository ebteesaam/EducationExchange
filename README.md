# EducationExchange

In this project, this is an app for exchanging learning material in King Abdulaziz university by Ebtesam Harith and Emtenan al Kayyal.

## Why this project?

This project aimed to develop mobile application for students to exchange used textbooks 
and lectures notes in King Abdul Aziz University in Rabigh. Students didn't know what 
they will do with their textbooks after passing the courses so probably they will get rid of it. 
On other side, students have problems on finding textbooks of their different courses. Moreover, 
the cost of some textbooks is expensive and some students cannot afford the price; 
some students think that printing book is cheaper for them. 
Education Exchange is an application for exchange textbooks and lecture notes easily. 
Student will be able to present their textbooks and lectures notes, searching for a material and communicate easily to take the materials. 
Students can request for specific course material using announcement. 
To develop this application, we used Microsoft Project to draw the Gant chart for developing planes and tracking progress, 
StarUML to create Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagram, attributes, operations, association roles.etc., 
Android Studio based on Java programming language to provide the guidelines, tools and ecosystem needed to design, 
build and publish the applications that run on android devices, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) to store, 
transport and shear data. With XML it is easy to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, 
or new browsers, without losing data. In addition, Firebase Database is used to provide some functionality like analytics, 
databases, messaging and crash reporting. Education Exchange run under android operating system. 
Finally, this application is intended to help students to find and exchange textbooks
and lecture notes easily and get rid of it positively by helping another student.

##Overall System Development
  The interfaces of Education Exchange application are designed by android studio and xml language. 
  The interface can be divided into two types dependent on the type of the user. 
  Each user whether students or administrator each one has different interface
